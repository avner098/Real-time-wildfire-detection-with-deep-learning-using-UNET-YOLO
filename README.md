# Real-time-wildfire-detection-with-deep-learning-using-UNET-YOLO
Forest fires can be caused by various factors, including extreme weather events or electrical failures, resulting in property damage and loss of human life. Our project aims to explore a method for segmenting live streams or videos captured by drones in real-time with maximum accuracy while maintaining optimal performance for displaying the segmentation results in real-time. We have opted to examine a model comprising YOLOv4 for detecting fires in each frame. YOLO will provide bounding boxes indicating the fire's location, which will then undergo padding. These padded boxes will be inputted into an Attention U-Net for segmentation. Additionally, we will explore the appropriate parameters, such as learning rate, epochs, batch size, and binary cross-entropy loss function, to meet all our requirements. We believe that the model we have studied will aid in identifying large forest fires in real-time, thereby contributing to the prevention of property damage and loss of human life.
