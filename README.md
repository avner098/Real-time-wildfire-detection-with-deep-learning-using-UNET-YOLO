# Real-time-wildfire-detection-with-deep-learning-using-UNET-YOLO
Forest fires can be caused by various factors, including extreme weather events or electrical failures, leading to property damage and loss of human life. In this project, we developed a method for segmenting live streams captured by drones in real-time, with a focus on achieving maximum accuracy while ensuring optimal performance for displaying segmentation results promptly. We implemented a model using YOLOv4 for detecting fires in each frame. YOLO provided bounding boxes indicating the fire's location, which were padded and then passed into an Attention U-Net for precise segmentation.
After experimenting with various hyperparameters such as learning rate, epochs, batch size, and the Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss function, we concluded that a learning rate of 1e-6 , a batch size of 32, and Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy provided the best results for real-time segmentation. The model was trained for 70 epochs using a mosaic dataset augmentation method to ensure diversity in the training data and improve generalization.
This project highlighted the critical role of hyperparameter tuning and model architecture, demonstrating how small adjustments can significantly impact model performance. Our final model showed great promise in identifying large forest fires in real-time, potentially aiding in the prevention of property damage and loss of human life.
